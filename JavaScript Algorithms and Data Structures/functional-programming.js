// # Functional Programming is another popular approach to software development. In Functional Programming, code is organized into smaller, basic functions that can be combined to build complex programs.

// In this course, you'll learn the core concepts of Functional Programming including pure functions, how to avoid mutations, and how to  write cleaner code with methods like '.map()' and '.filter()'.






// ## Learn About Functional Programming

// Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope: 'INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT'

// Functional programming is about:

    // 1. Isolated functions-there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change.
    // 2. Pure functions-the same input always gives the same output
    // 3. Functions with limited side effects-any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled

// The members of freeCodeCamp happen to love tea.

// In the code editor, the 'prepareTea' and 'getTea' functions are already defined for you. Call the 'getTea' function to get 40 cups of tea for the team, and store them in the 'tea4TeamFCC' variable.

// // Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea
// const prepareTea = () => 'greenTea';

// /*
// Given a function (representing the tea type) and number of cups needed, the following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of a specific type of tea).
// */

// const getTea = (numOfCups) => {
//     const teaCups = [];

//     for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
//         const teaCup = prepareTea();
//         teaCups.push(teaCup);
//     }
//     return teaCups;
// }

// // Only change code below this line
// const tea4TeamFCC = getTea(40);

// console.log(tea4TeamFCC.length);
// // Only change code above this line






// ## Understand Functional Programming Terminology

// The FCC Team had a mood swing and now wants two types of tea: green tea and black tea. General Fact: Client mood swings are pretty common.

// With that information, we'll need to revisit the 'getTea' function from last challenge to handle various tea requests. We can modify 'getTea' to accept a function as a parameter to be able to change the type of tea it prepares. This makes 'getTea' more flexible, and gives the programmer more control when client requests change.

// But first, let's cover some function terminology:

// Callbacks are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function. You may have seen them passed to other methods, for example in 'filter', the callback function tells JavaScript the criteria for how to filter an array.

// Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called first class functions. In JavaScript, all functions are first class functions.

// The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value, are called higher order functions.

// When functions are passed in to or returned from another function, then those functions which were passed in or returned can be called a lambda.

// Prepare 27 cups of green tea and 13 cups of black tea and store them in 'tea4GreenteamFCC' and 'tea4BlackTeamFCC' variables, respectively. Note that the 'getTea' function has been modified so it now takes a function as the first argument.

// Note: The data (the number of cups of tea) is supplied as the last argument. We'll discuss this more in later lessons.

// // Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea
// const prepareGreenTea = () => 'greenTea';

// // Function that returns a string representing a cup of black tea
// const prepareBlackTea = () => 'blackTea';

// /*
// Given a function (representing the tea type) and number of cups needed, the following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of a specific type of tea).
// */

// const getTea = (prepareTea, numOfCups) => {
//     const teaCups = [];

//     for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
//         const teaCup = prepareTea();
//         teaCups.push(teaCup);
//     }
//     return teaCups;
// }

// // Only change code below this line
// const tea4GreenteamFCC = getTea(prepareGreenTea, 27);
// const tea4BlackTeamFCC = getTea(prepareBlackTea, 13);
// // Only change code above this line

// console.log(
//     tea4GreenteamFCC,
//     tea4BlackTeamFCC
// );




// ## Understand the Hazards of Using Imperative Code

// Functional programming is a good habit. It keeps your code easy to manage, and saves you from sneaky bugs. But before we get there, let's look at an imperative approach to programming to highlight where you  may have issues.

// In English (and many other languages), the imperative tense is used to give commands. Similarly, an Imperative style in programming is one that gives the computer a set of statements to perform a task.

// Often the statements change the state of the program, like updating global variables. A classic example is writing a 'for' loop that gives exact directions to iterate over the indices of an array.

// In contrast, functional programming is a form of declarative programming. You tell the computer what you want done by calling a method or function.

// JavaScript offers many predefined methods that handle common tasks so you don't need to write out how the computer should perform them. For example, instead of using the 'for' loop mentioned above, you could call the 'map' method which handles the details of iterating over an array. This helps to avoid semantic errors, like the "Off By One Errors" that were covered in the Debugging section.

// Consider this scenario: you are browsing the web in your browser, and want to track the tabs you have opened. Let's try to model this using some simple object-oriented code.

// A Window object is made up of tabs, and you usually have more than one Window open. The titles of each open site in each Window object is held in an array. After working in the browser (opening new tabs, merging windows, and closing tabs), you want to print the tabs that are still open. Closed tabs are removed from the array and new tabs (for simplicity) get added to the end of it.

// The code editor shows an implementation of this functionality with functions for 'tabOpen()', 'tabClose()', and 'join()'. The array 'tabs' is part of the Window object that stores the name of the open pages.

// Examine the code in the editor. It's using a method that has side effects in the program, causing incorrect behaviour. The final list of open tabs, stored in 'finalTabs.tabs', should '['FB', 'Gitter', 'Reddit', 'Twitter', 'Medium', 'new tab', 'Netflix', 'YouTube', 'Vine', 'GMail', 'Work mail', 'Docs', 'freeCodeCamp', 'new tab']' but the list produced by the code is slightly different.

// Change 'Window.prototype.tabClose' so that it removes the correct tab.

// // tabs is an array of titles of each site open within the window
// const Window = function(tabs) {
//     this.tabs = tabs; // We keep a record of the array inside the object
// };

// // When you join two windows into one window
// Window.prototype.join = function(otherWindow) {
//     this.tabs = this.tabs.concat(otherWindow.tabs);
//     return this;
// };

// // When you open a new tab at the end
// Window.prototype.tabOpen = function(tab) {
//     this.tabs.push('new tab'); // let's open a new tab for now
//     return this;
// }

// // When you close a tab
// Window.prototype.tabClose = function(index) {

//     // Only change code below this line

//     const tabsBeforeIndex = this.tabs.splice(0, index); // Get the tabs before the tab
//     const tabsAfterIndex = this.tabs.splice(index + 1); // Get the tabs after the tab

//     this.tabs = tabsBeforeIndex.concat( tabsAfterIndex); // Join them together

//     // Only change code above this line

//     return this;
// };

// // Let's create three browser windows
// const workWindow = new Window(['GMail', 'Inbox', 'Work mail', 'Docs', 'freeCodeCamp']); // your mailbox, drive, and other work sites
// const socialWindow = new Window(['FB', 'Gitter', 'Reddit', 'Twitter', 'Medium']); // Social sites
// const videoWindow = new Window(['Netflix', 'YouTube', 'Vimeo', 'Vine']); // Entertainment sites

// // Now perform the tab opening, closing, and other operations
// const finalTabs = socialWindow
//     .tabOpen() // Open a new tab for cat memes
//     .join(videoWindow.tabClose(2)) // Close third tab in video window, and join
//     .join(workWindow.tabClose(1).tabOpen());
// console.log(finalTabs.tabs);






// ## Avoid Mutations and Side Effects Using Functional Programming

// If you haven't already figured it out, the issue in the previous challenge was with the 'splice' call in the 'tabClose()' function, Unfortunately, 'splice' changes the original array it is called on, so the second call to it used a modified array, and gave unexpected results.

// This is a small example of a much larger pattern- you call a function on a variable, array, or an object, and the function changes the variable or something in the object.

// One of the core principles of functional programming is to not change things. Changes lead to bugs. It's eaier to prevent bugs knowing that your functions don't change anything, including the function arguments or any global variable.

// The previous example didin't have any complicated orperations but the 'splice' method changed the original array, and resulted in a bug.

// Recall that in functional programming, changin or altering things is called mutation, and the outcome is called a side effect. A function, ideally, should be a pure function, meaning that it does not cause any side effects.

// Let's try to master this dicipline and not alter any variable or object in our code.

// Fill in the code for the function 'incrementer' so it returns the value of the global variable 'fixedValue' increased by one.

// // The global variable
// let fixedValue = 4;

// function incrementer() {
//     // Only change code below this line
//     return fixedValue + 1;
//     // Only change code below this line
// };

// console.log(incrementer());






// Pass Arguments to Avoid External Dependence in a Function

// The last challenge was a step closer to functional programming principles, but there is still something missing.

// We didn't alter the global variable value, but the function 'incrementer' would not work without the global variable 'fixedValue' being there.

// Another principle of functional programming is to always declare your dependencies explicitly. This means if a functions depends on a variable or object being present, then pass that variable or object directly into the function as an argument.

// There are several good consequences from this principle. The Function is easier to test, you know exactley what input it takes, and it won't depend on anything else in your program.

// This can give you more confidence when you alter, remove, or add new code. You would know what you can or cannot change and you can see where the potential traps are.

// Finally, the function would always produce the same output for the same set of inputs, no matter what part of the code executes it.

// Let's update the 'incrementer' function to clearly declare its dependencies.

// Write the ''incrementer' function so it takes an argument, and then returns a result after increasing the value by one.

// //  The global variable
// let fixedValue = 4;

// // Only change code below this line
// function incrementer(value)
// {
//     return value += 1
//     // Only change code above this line
// };





// ## Refactor Global Variables Out of Functions

// So far, we have seen two distinct principles for functional programming:
    // 1. Don't alter a variable or object- create new variables and objects and return them if need be from a function. Hint: using something like 'const newArr = arrVar', where 'arrVar' is an array will simply create a reference to the existing variable and not a copy. So changing a value in 'newArr' would change the value in 'arrVar'.
    // 2. Declare function parameters-any computation inside a function depends only on the arguments passed to the function, and not on any global object or variable.

// Adding one to a number is not very exciting, but we can apply these principles when working with arrays or more complex objects.

// Rewrite the code so the global array 'bookList' is not changed inside either function. The 'add' function should add the given 'bookName' to the end of the array passed to it and return a new array (list). The 'remove' function should remove the given 'bookName' from the array passed to it.

// // The global variable
// const bookList = ["The Hound of the Baskervilles", "On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies", "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae"];

// // Change code below this line
// function add(bookListArr, bookName) {
//     return [...bookListArr, bookName];
//     // Change code above this line
// };

// // Change code below this line
// function remove(bookListArr, bookName) {
//     const defenestrateArray = [...bookListArr];
//     const book_index = defenestrateArray.indexOf(bookName);
//     if (book_index >= 0) {
//       defenestrateArray.splice(book_index, 1);
//       return defenestrateArray;
  
//       // Change code above this line
//       }
//   }

// console.log(add(bookList, "Sears and Zemansky's University Physics with Modern Physics"));
// console.log(add(bookList, "Complete Book of C Programming"));
// console.log()

// console.log(remove(bookList, bookList[0]))
// console.log(remove(bookList, bookList[1]))






// Use the map Method to Extract Data from an Array

// So far we have learned to use pure functions to avoid side effects in a program. Also, we have seen the value in having a function only depend on its input arguments.

// This in only the beginning. As its name suggests, functional programming is centered around a theory of functions.

// It would make sense to be able to pass them as arguments to other functions, and return a  function from another function. Functions are considered first class objects in JavaScript, which means they can be used like any other object. They can be saved in variables, stored in an object, or passed as function arguments.

// Let's start with some simple array funcitons, which are methods on the array object prototype. In this exercise wer are looking at 'Array.prototype.map()', or more simply 'map'.

// The 'map' method iterates over each item in an array and returns a new array containing the results of calling the callback function on each element. It does this without mutating the original array.

// When the callback is used, it is passed three arguments. The first argument is the current element being processed. the second is the index of that element and the third is the array upon which the 'map' method was called.

// See below for an example using the 'map' method on the 'users' array to return a new array containing only the names of the users as elements. For simplicity, the example only uses the first argument of the callback.

// const users = [
//     { name: 'John', age: 34 },
//     { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
//     { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
// ];

// const names = users.map(user => user.name);
// console.log(names);

// The 'watchList' array holds objects with informaiton on several movies. Use 'map' on 'watchList' to assign a new array of objects to the 'ratings' variable. Each movie in the new array should have only a 'title' key with the name of the film, and a 'rating' key with the IMDB rating. The code in the editor currently uses a 'for' loop to do this, so you should replace the loop functionality with your 'map' expression.

// The global variable

// const watchList = [

// ## Implement map on a Prototype

// As you have seen from applying 'Array.protoype.map()', or simply 'map()' earlier, the 'map' method returns an array of the same length as the one it was called on. It also doesn't alter the original array, as long as its callback function
